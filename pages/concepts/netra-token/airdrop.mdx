# Airdrop ($NTT)

Netra Transitory Token (NTT) is a reward token for Netra NFT holders that can be exchanged for $NETRA token after Phase 2 with a fixed floor price of $0.002 USDC through our buy-back & burn mechanism.
$NTT can only be generated from holding Netra NFT. If there are a lot of requests to buy $NTT directly, the team will make NTT available for trading on Uniswap.
The amount of $NTT claimable by each wallet will be determined by 3 contributing factors:
Total mint price
The higher the mint price of total NFTs in a wallet, the more $NTT.
Duration of NFT holding.
The earlier a wallet holds Netra NFT, the more $NTT
Whitelist minting
Additional $NTT for whitelisted users who minted on the whitelist minting days.
In recap, holders who minted more NFTs and collected the earliest drops will get the most benefit of getting more $NTT that later on can be exchanged to $NETRA token.

## Calculation

The acrued reward for each NFT is calculated using [cumulative function](#cummulative-function) that is based by the [base point](#base-point), which is influenced by the **fiat price of an NFT**. The **distribution will happen hourly** based on the duration of when and how long the NFT has been held after minting or last claim.

### Base Point

It is a constant value used for reward calculation. Simply the higher the Base Point, the higher the reward is — same for the opposite.

The value is different according to what token used for minting:

1. **USDC**: The value is generated from the sale price (in USDC) at mint time using Chainlink’s OCR.

2. **IDR**: The point is calculated by the price (in IDR) divided by 14,500

### Cummulative Function

It is a function that calculates how much NTT will be rewarded. The f(x, base) is crafted to incentivise the ealiest minter and loyal holder. After 14 days, the reward is set to a constant 1% from base point.
