# Airdrop

Netra Transitory Token (NTT) is a reward token for Netra FMA holders that can be exchanged for $NETRA token after Phase 2 with a fixed floor price of $0.002 USDC through our buy-back & burn mechanism.
$NTT can only be generated from holding Netra FMA. If there are a lot of requests to buy $NTT directly, the team will make NTT available for trading on Uniswap.
The amount of $NTT claimable by each wallet will be determined by 3 contributing factors:
Total mint price
The higher the mint price of total FMAs in a wallet, the more $NTT.
Duration of FMA holding.
The earlier a wallet holds Netra FMA, the more $NTT
Whitelist minting
Additional $NTT for whitelisted users who minted on the whitelist minting days.
In recap, holders who minted more FMAs and collected the earliest drops will get the most benefit of getting more $NTT that later on can be exchanged to $NETRA token.

# Floor Price (Buyback)

In order to guard the value of NTT, we provide a BUYBACK & BURN mechanism for NTT because we believe in the value of Netra in the future.
Netra platform will happily buy back any NTT for the fixed price of $0.002 USDC per token to users who are willing to sell their NTT.
The NTT bought will be automatically burned and will reduce the total supply, hence it will provide buying pressure for NTT.
Through this mechanism, when NTT is traded below the floor price, you can simply buy NTT on the market and sell it back to us at the floor price.
Go to NTT page if you want to sell and burn your NTT! (caveat: you will lose the chance of getting $NETRA token in the future)
