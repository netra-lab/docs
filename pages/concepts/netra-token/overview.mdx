# Overview

> [$NTT](#ntt) is a transitory token that will be exchangeable to $NETRA

As a community-first platform, community members and creators will be **rewarded for participating** in the Netra ecosystem as well as **decentralizing our platform** through DAO using $NETRA.

$NETRA is an ERC20-token based on Polygon, which represents the share of ownership in the Netra community. $NETRA will be launched at 2023, together with the transition to phase 2 which is decentralizing our platform by delegating the decision making to the community.

Majority of the $NETRA allocation is for the community. We start by distributing Netra Transitory Token ($NTT) to our early adopters, which represents the allocation for the initial $NETRA airdrop, then the $NTT can be exchangeable for $NETRA at launch.

$NTT can be earned by simply holding Netra FMA, every hour will generate $NTT based on the FMA(s) owned. Learn more about the distribution in the [airdrop and distribution section](/concepts/netra-token/airdrop).

In this phase, Netra will be an ecosystem where community members get rewarded for each transaction that happens in the Netra platform, and contribute to maintain a sustainable economic model that drives Netra financial system.
